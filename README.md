## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Java Interpreter Framework with JavaFX UI

Welcome to the repository featuring an advanced interpreter framework developed in Java, meticulously crafted for executing and simulating programs in custom-defined programming languages. This framework leverages the powerful capabilities of Java and enriches them with JavaFX to offer a dynamic graphical user interface, enhancing both user interaction and the visual representation of program execution.

### üåü Key Features

- **Dynamic Type Checking:** Ensures rigorous type safety through exhaustive compile-time and runtime checks, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of program execution.
- **Concurrency Support:** Utilizes Java's `ExecutorService` to manage multiple execution threads effectively, demonstrating robust concurrency management within the interpreter.
- **Memory Management:** Implements custom strategies for garbage collection and reference management, simulating an advanced heap storage mechanism.
- **Advanced Locking Mechanisms:** Incorporates sophisticated locking mechanisms, including lock tables and synchronized blocks, to ensure thread synchronization and safe access to shared resources.
- **JavaFX Graphical User Interface:** Provides a rich graphical user interface using JavaFX, making the interpreter both accessible and user-friendly. Features interactive elements such as menus, buttons, and text areas for script input and results display.
- **Customizable Syntax and Operations:** Supports an extensive array of operations and structures, ranging from simple arithmetic to intricate file operations and logical gates.
- **Styling with CSS:** Enhances the UI's visual appeal and usability by integrating CSS for JavaFX component styling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Core Development:** Java 11
- **User Interface:** JavaFX for robust graphical user interface development
- **Concurrency:** Advanced multithreading for concurrent execution management
- **Data Structures:** Custom data structures designed for optimal type and state management
- **Styling:** Tailored CSS for enhancing the aesthetic and functional aspects of JavaFX components

This project serves as an invaluable tool for both educational purposes and personal exploration, ideal for those keen on delving into the intricacies of programming languages and interpreter design. The use of JavaFX adds a layer of interactivity that enriches the user experience, making complex programming concepts more approachable and engaging.
