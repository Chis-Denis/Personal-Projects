üõ†Ô∏èJava-Based Interpreter for Custom Programming Languages

This repository has a robust interpreter framework written in Java that is utilized for executing and simulating programs in user-specified programming languages. The interpreter leverages advanced Java features like multithreading-based concurrency management, dynamic type checking, and user-specified memory management functions. It has a modular architecture with a variety of statements and expressions that emulate real programming constructs like control flow, file operations, and memory allocation.

Key Features:

Dynamic Type Checking: Offers type safety during operations with strict compile-time and runtime checks. Concurrency Support: Utilizes Java's ExecutorService to manage concurrent execution threads, showing the management of concurrent tasks in the interpreter. Memory Management: Offers proprietary garbage collection and reference management to simulate a heap storage mechanism. Customizable Syntax and Operations: Supports a wide range of operations and structures, from basic arithmetic to complex file operations and logical gates. Interactive Command-Line Menu: Offers a text menu for interactively selecting and running pre-defined scripts, enhancing usability and test flexibility. 

Technology Stack:

Java 11 for core development; Multithreading for concurrency; Custom data structures for type and state management; 
This It is a very useful and practical project of a learning tool that pours insight into programming language and interpreter internals. As an educational tool or simply for fun, this framework forms good ground for extending and experimentation with language and interpreter functionality.
