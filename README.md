Java-Based Interpreter for Custom Programming Languages

This repository hosts a robust interpreter framework developed in Java, designed for simulating and executing programs written in custom-defined programming languages. The interpreter leverages advanced Java features, including concurrency management with multithreading, dynamic type checking, and custom memory management routines. It's equipped with a modular architecture featuring a variety of statements and expressions that simulate real-world programming constructs like control flow, file operations, and memory allocation.

Key Features:

Dynamic Type Checking: Ensures type safety across operations with thorough compile-time and runtime checks.
Concurrency Support: Utilizes Javaâ€™s ExecutorService to manage simultaneous execution threads, showcasing the handling of concurrent tasks within the interpreter.
Memory Management: Implements custom garbage collection and reference management to simulate a heap storage mechanism.
Customizable Syntax and Operations: Supports a wide range of operations and structures, from basic arithmetic to complex file handling and logical gates.
Interactive Command-Line Menu: Offers a text-based menu to interactively select and run predefined scripts, enhancing usability and testing flexibility.
Technology Stack:

Java 11 for core development
Multithreading for concurrency
Custom data structures for state and type management
Designed for educational purposes, this project serves as a practical tool for understanding the inner workings of programming languages and interpreters. Whether for academic use or personal exploration, this framework provides a solid foundation for extending and experimenting with language design and interpreter functionalities.
